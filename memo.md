# Revnets | A Growth Engine for the Unstoppable Open Internet

This memo makes the case for revnets and $REV for investors, entrepreneurs, and customers of products and services monetized on the open internet. It is delivered in 3 parts:
1. **What's the big deal?:** Provides context about the problem and how revnets are positioned to play a role in shaping the future.
2. **What are the terms?:** Includes specifics of how you are invited to participate as investors.
3. **What do they look like?:** Illustrates the opportunity with examples, case studies, and a peak into various game changing revnets being planned.

In so doing, it'll also lay out the strategy for the future of Juicebox DAO ($JBX), whose upcoming Juicebox V4 protocol will host a fee collecting project modeled as a revnet.

## Part 1 – What's the big deal?

### 1.1 TLDR

Today's crypto and media networks have a business model problem, rooted in the tensions between open source productivity and private value capture. 

As the web rapidly tends towards being more open – with agreements expressed through crypto protocols on public blockchains, and AIs able to generate code and information of just about anything – we need a value capture system that resolves this tension and reorients us towards collaborative growth.

Revnets offer a promising solution, as a hands-free all-in-one tokenized incentive machine, cap table, and growth engine for leaders, workers, investors, and yesterday's customers that helped make today possible, while removing common causes of disputes between them.

Revnets are an openly-accounted-for standard that can motivate the funding and distribution of business offerings, open source projects, campaigns, indie media, and cultural movements without governance risks, liquidity requirements, or management overhead. Simple enough for a group of friends, powerful enough for high net-worth, global communities, products, and brands.

Join us – a group of Web3 builders who have helped facilitate over $180 million through the Juicebox protocol – in founding and growing the $REV network, which operates as revenue-generating revnet itself.

### 1.2 Overview

Open source and openly accounted-for fundraises and revenues should outcompete everything by enabling:

- **Scaled Participation:** Flexible and potentially-global community with vested interests.
- **Full Transparency:** Public code and accounting is more trustworthy and easier to cooperate with.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Many managerial and other expenses are not needed when there are no secrets or artificial barriers to progress.

They struggle to enforce revenue generation to pay for innovation, maintenance, and growth due to three core dilemmas:

- **Monetization Dilemma:** Establishing and justifying debt obligations, growth expenditures, and profit margins on revenue is difficult as an open business scales.
- **Moat Dilemma:** The work and strategies of open businesses can be copied without inheriting the baggage of the original, meaning cheaper alternatives can emerge easily, devaluing the various costs borne by the original.
- **Dependency Dilemma:** Many profitable businesses rely deeply on open source components, yet don't have clarity on how to foster a productive financial relationship with their communities, or motivation to do so unless developed in-house.

This makes realizing open ideals reliant on free and inconsistent labor, donations, grants, or corporate sponsorship, when this should instead be the most investable and rewarding category of internet business.

Web3's auto-enforceable blockchain agreements are the correct building block on which to build legitimate decentralized value networks, but today's attempted business model solutions are incomplete and come with unsustainable tradeoffs. Businesses and investors currently have the following options for monetizing onchain:

- **Liquidity farming:** Tokenized models marketed as open and yield providing, but with implicit or explicit backdoors for insiders to dump on retail once they've filled their bags. 
- **Governance DAOs:** Tokenized voting systems that decide how raised funds and revenues should be spent, creating power struggles that get in the way of effective capital allocation.
- **Revenue sharing:** Tokenized guarantees that sales will be split between certain entities, but with no follow-on incentive for propagating network growth after fees have been extracted.
- **NFT memberships:** Rare tokenized artifacts whose value will speculatively increase as the issuing entity becomes popularized, but with no liquidity apart from exhausting pump and dumps.
- **Custom mechanisms:** Custom tokenization dynamic with a unique set of coded rules that attempt to fulfill a desired set of outcomes, but requiring everyone to learn a new jargon-filled system and trust that it is implemented bug free.
- **Grants and donations:** No tokenized monetization strategy, just builders and investors with an expectation that their value creation, if done openly, will be retroactively rewarded by altruists who directly benefited from the outcomes.
- **No progress:** Take investments and fees to a centralized wallet to operate from just like traditional capital structures, with no networked benefits from the tools at our disposal apart perhaps from automated vesting, airdrops of meme tokens not actually backed by revenue, or tokenized accounting of its own books.

These have often led to misallocated resources and capital losses.

We need a better place to put our entrepreneurial capital and use it effectively. A revenue-forward growth-oriented solution that is sustainable, reliable, simple, and massively scalable to help every value-creating business with an online growth presence – local and global – realize their potential in the upcoming tokenized economy.

We think revnets might be it: A win-win-win growth engine for investors, builders, and retail customers of open source and beyond. Built by developers who've helped facilitate over $185 million in ETH payments over their past 4 years of experience designing, building, securing, and distributing Ethereum-based tokenization infrastructure.

Revnets are easy to use, a bicycle for online economies. They resolve the three dilemmas above by creating openly-accounted-for financial networks with bounded risks that benefit those who pay fees, invest, help the network grow and stick around. They are great for startups overcoming the cold start problem, and a great exit strategy for established organizations such as governance DAOs like UNI, ENS, ARB, JBX, and others who prefer tending towards autopilot growth benefiting all members.

Importantly, revnets aren't just an esoteric tool for obscure internet subcultures. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink and prominent others say the necessary and inevitable tokenization of everything will enhance the landscape of finance. As Fink puts it, "the next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities."[^2] We have understood this for years. We think revnets will participate in the mainstream's vision by being the most productive structure for both large organizations and small businesses who will need to have their revenues, fundraises, compensation, and global financial partnerships tokenized in order to better serve their customers. Revnets are the SAFE and C-Corp agreements of this economy, but 100x better.

We're deploying a $REV revnet that'll earn 2.5% of all funds cashed out from fundraises and revenues from all revnets. We invite you to take part in $REV, the first 90 days favor grassroots investors on equal terms. We're also supporting the launch of revnets for six other spectacular projects we've been working with, demonstrating how revnets are:

- **Versatile:** This simple financial instrument has the power to support diverse applications.
- **Standardized:** They create a familiar business interaction standard, leading to a positive feedback loop for all revnet-based projects.
- **Interoperable:** They have the ability to relate financial outcomes between each other, encouraging more collaboration within a competitive business landscape. 

Projects will choose a revnet business structure when they prefer their outcome to be oriented towards maximizing the network's self-propagation while minimizing the potential of any party with privileged access and exploitable liabilites. They'll understand their work to have value while also understanding a network's preference to work for itself once instigated, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### 1.3 Anatomy of a revnet | Introduction

Think of revnets like a spicy Bitcoin halvening rule. Similar to Bitcoin, revnets are a fully pre-configured financial structure – although they can evolve over time, they do so according to rules that are set in place at the time of their creation. Unlike Bitcoin, the rules dont involve proof-of-work with periodic supply shocks that lead to a fixed supply of 21m coins over time. Revnets enforce a certain other set of guarantees affecting inflows and outflows of money.

These guarantees can be visualized as a digital vending machine:
1. Receives dollar bills from a business's raised funds and revenues.
2. Dispenses its unique tokens (henceforth $TOKENs) and optionally digital artifacts (NFTs) in return.
3. The only way to access the dollar bills the machine has earned is to give it its $TOKENs back.

Revnets enforce three main customizable rules that can be preset to change over time, but whose sequence is fixed once set:

- **$TOKEN price:** There is always a price at which the revnet is willing to issue new $TOKENs. If there exists an AMM offering a better rate than the $TOKEN issuance price, the revnet will instead forward inbound funds to the AMM.
- **$TOKEN split:** The purchase of $TOKENs can split some off to a privileged account.
- **Cash out tax:** $TOKENs can be cashed out by returning them to the revnet, which distributes some of the revnet's revenues back to the holder. A non-zero tax rate means each cash out increases the value of the next cash out, rewarding those who stick around longer. 

> For example:
> 1. A revnet can be paid in ETH, and/or other tokens (shown below as green dollar bills).
> 2. Payments generate its own tokens at a given price, say 1 ETH buys 1,000 $TOKEN (shown as orange $Rs). The payment may also yield an NFT artifact (shown as blue cards).
> 3. A revnet can have a split in place that automatically sends a percentage of these new $TOKENs to a set of pre-established entities, say 20% split so that 100 $TOKEN goes to each of two builders and 80% goes to the payer of the 1 ETH.
> 4. The ETH stay in the vending machine.

<img width="582" style="margin-bottom: 20px;" alt="Screenshot_2024-01-21_at_17 59 01" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6776a77f-acc1-4cdf-92b6-c963592af75d">
<br>
<br>

> 5. In order to get the 1 ETH back out, a $TOKEN holder has to cash out, which incurs a tax.
> 6. This means if one of the builders wanted to cash out their 100 $TOKENs right away, they would get less than the proportional 0.1 ETH if a tax was in place, leaving revenue on the table for those who cash out later.
>    
> The specifics of the issuance price, split, and cash out tax are set as a sequence of fixed-duration stages that are all specified when the revnet is deployed.

<img width="599" style="margin-bottom: 20px;" alt="Screenshot_2024-01-21_at_17 58 43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a591cd88-ca9a-4f09-9621-57d8fb28f436">
<br>
<br>

This means revnets are:

- **Governance-free**: Governance inefficiencies and takeovers of funds are impossible.
- **Management-scoped**: Revnets operate autonomously according to their pre-configured rules, scoping risks and making overreach impossible.
- **Liquid**: Revnets work with the open market to make and take liquidity, helping startups bootstrap growth and making market manipulation unfavorable.
- **Deterministic**: Investors, builders, community, and customers each act within a revnet's known rules, enforced programmatically from start to finish.
- **Familiar**: Transparency and diligence are simple. Once one revnet's workings makes sense, all revnets make sense.

Revnets also inherit the best properties of Ethereum:

- **Immediacy**: Encode sophisticated financial relationships between global participants with immediate settlement.
- **Clarity**: Allow for ownership and access rules that can't be subjectively misinterpreted.
- **Certainty**: Express and enforce clearly scheduled rules.
- **Auditability**: Impossible to hide, simplifying diligence for all participants.
- **Composability**: Easy, reliable, and open access to and from other smart contracts, including other revnets for interdependent accounting schemas.

As a result of its properties, a revnet's $TOKENs are reliably backed by the underlying value of the revenue used to issue them. This makes $TOKENs great collateral for loans, which each revnet also offers, for a fee paid into itself.

Part 2 of this memo digs in deeper, and discusses how we are tuning the $REV revnet for deployment. Part 3 follows with examples, case studies, and hypothetical scenarios.

### 1.4 Why now? Why us?

Those of us developing revnets have been contributors to the Ethereum ecosystem over the past 4 years, most notably having helped build the Juicebox protocol, the juicebox.money app, and the Juicebox DAO community driven by the $JBX network. Juicebox is public infrastructure that provides a tokenized language for expressing various organizational financial guarantees. It has been fundamental to the making of Constitution DAO, Assange DAO, Shark DAO, Moon DAO, Cryo DAO, Juicebox DAO, the Tornado Cash developer legal defense fundraiser and 1,331 other projects, facilitating over $185 million in ETH payments.

In this era of crypto and media networks that innovate on internet-native concepts, and with societal demand for mobility[^1], private corporate-stock models of centralized organization are anachronistic. We've experienced the demand for tokenized fundraising and revenue first hand, we know the tradeoffs of the tokenization tools at our disposal intimately well, and we know how cultural narratives around tokens work. We've been consistently one step ahead of the curve and steadfast in our values.

We've also seen the negligence and gross extractive tendencies that over-leveraged entrepreneurs, investors, and traders can succumb to when left unchecked.  Blockchains give us transactional freedoms – using them to progress positive-sum game-theoretic financial applications like revnets is non-trivial, while using them to manipulate the public with hyped-up zero-sum Ponzi schemes is easy and unfortunately all too common.

Revnets are the next step. They are an expression of the Juicebox language we know so well, and the tokenized standard we're sorely missing to encourage more projects – many of our own – hit the gas with confidence and without incumbent tradeoffs. 

For those already familiar with Juicebox, note that revnets are Juicebox projects with two main restrictions:
- **No Ownership:** They are owned by a special smart contract that enforces rules throughout the project's life, as opposed to being owned by an entity that can influence changes over time. This contract grants a few scoped permissions to the address initially specified as the revnet's split operator.
- **No Payouts:** They don't allow for payouts, meaning all funds stay in the treasury backing the value of the project's tokens, and can only be accessed by token holders themselves. 

You can see the specifics in the revnet smart contract https://github.com/rev-net/revnet-core.

The time for revnets is now – revnets would be too fragile to exist if a rent-seeking fiduciary facilitating the handling of money (banks) or rules (courts) was required, and can only outcompete as an encoded contract between network participants enforced by the blockchain protocols of today. 

Speculatively, if AI-agent networks continue to gain adoption, revnets will exist to empower users of AI-produced goods and services who's marginal cost of labor tends toward zero, in contrast to incumbent models that extract from users to empower AIs and their centralized creators.

We've been working on revnets conceptually since late 2023, they're now implemented and ready for showtime. Importantly, revnets are built using Juicebox V4, whose fee collecting project will itself be modeled as a revnet. Juicebox V4's main innovation is enabling omnichain projects, meanning each revnet can exist across any number of blockchains and extend to new ones as they emerge and prove legitimate. This also means all revnets will show up on juicebox.money and other Juicebox explorers by default. Part 2 further explains how these entities relate.

### 1.5 Call to action

Revnets can power millions of startups to become global movements, high net-worth interconnected economies, and retail-owned brands that outcompete traditional private alternatives, meanwhile helping incumbent businesses – for-profit and non-profit corporations and associations – transition to the more powerful open internet.

With revnets, the open internet will outcompete private alternatives _because_ it best serves creatives, builders, investors, and consumers alike.

We're calling on all who believe in this revenue-forward version of the open internet to join the $REV network. The more we help each emergent revnet win, the more we win, the more the open internet wins. Read Part 2 of this memo if you're leaning in, and join the $REV testnet https://www.revnet.app/sepolia/net/2.

## Part 2 – What are the terms?

### 2.1 Overview

Investors interested in the promise of revnets should know there are three core entities at play:
- **$REV:** A revnet benefiting from the growth of revnets.
- **Revnet Research Group, LLC (RRG):** The split operator of the $REV revnet to start.
- **Revnet Fund 1, LLC (RF1):** A fund that interfaces between traditional limited partners and onchain revnets.

It is important to also mention Juicebox DAO ($JBX), the community instrumental to the research and development of revnets – revnets are built using Juicebox V4 after all. $JBX is the mothership and will continue to be the juicebox ecosystem's governance token that invests in its development while managing and allocating a book of assets, largely juicebox-based and revnet-based tokens it holds.

Juicebox V4's fee collecting token will also be a revnet with the ticker $NANA. It will act as a revenue-generating unit of account owned in large part by Juicebox DAO.

Out of these, $JBX and $REV are the only interesting investments for onchain allocators. RF1 is the only interesting investment for offchain allocators.

In summary, they all have the following relationships:
- $REV's split is operated by RRG, described in upcoming sections.
- $NANA's split is operated by Juicebox DAO.
- RRG makes, secures, and markets tools that help make $REV and other revnets more successful.
- Juicebox DAO makes, secures, and markets the Juicebox V4 protocol with which all revnets are expressed.
- $NANA operates as a revnet.
- Each revnet pays a 2.5% cash out fee to $NANA (enforced by the Juicebox V4 protocol) and a 2.5% cash out fee to $REV (enforced by the revnet contract). 5% total. 
- RF1 takes in dollars from investors and limited partners, then converts to crypto for allocating to $REV and other revnet $TOKENs it believes in.

The upcoming section will go through the specifics in detail, with visual diagrams to show how these interactions work.

### 2.2 Anatomy of a revnet | Advanced

Understanding the terms of the gameplan first requires elaborating on a revnet's anatomy. 

Revnets unfold in stages. Each stage specifies five rules that dictate everything about how the revnet operates:

| **Rule**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Duration**       | How long does the stage last? A revnet’s final stage lasts forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **$TOKEN Price**          | **Starting price:** How much does it cost to buy a single $TOKEN when the stage begins? The payment's value stays within the revnet and can only be accessed by $TOKEN holders who cash out or take out loans. <br> **Price increase:** How frequently, and by how much, does the $TOKEN's price increase within the stage?                                                                    |
| **Split**          | What percentage of $TOKEN issuance (and buybacks) are set aside for a list of split recipients, and which address is the split operator? The split operator can add and remove recipients from the split list, changing how the split is allocated within the fixed percentage set for the stage.                                                                                    |
| **Automint**       | How many $TOKENs get minted to a list of recipients at the start of the stage? This functions like a "pre-mint" only accessible once the stage has started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Cash out tax**   | How much does the revnet's next potential cash out increase each time a $TOKEN holder cashes out? This means each revnet always quotes a cash out exchange rate that gets better as others cash out, take out loans, or new funds come in. The cash out tax is specified with a number 0-1, with 0.99 being the most intense tax and 0 being no tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Revnets inherit some useful properties from Juicebox V4:
- **AMM Liquidity:** If $TOKEN holders add liquidity to an AMM[^3] and it offers a better price than the revnet, the revnet will route incoming payments to that market instead of issuing new $TOKENs. The revnet's split is applied to these buybacks as well.                 
- **Multicurrency:** A revnet can accept and hold any number of assets received as revenue, though it defines its $TOKEN price in one consistent currency. If it issues 1,000 $TOKENs per ETH and the revnet is paid some USDC, $TOKENs are issued given the current USDC/ETH price. The revnet can be set up to either hold the USDC received and allow its $TOKEN holders to cash out from this balance, or auto-swap the USDC for an asset it prefers to hold. The network's $TOKENs are backed by the assets it chooses to hold, inheriting their risks and opportunities. 
- **Omni-chain:** Revnets can grow to accept money on new EVM-compatible networks[^4] as they emerge, and also offer cash outs on those networks. Holders can move their $TOKENs between chains. When they do, the revnet automatically moves its assets so that the $TOKENs maintain their underlying value. 

#### Tuning

Notice, revnets can be tuned to achieve various outcomes. They are not cheatcodes for entrepreneurs and investors lacking earnest real world insight, nor capital magnets for those expecting a free lunch. They still take strategy, risk, storytelling, and execution, amplifying those who follow through. 

Each revnet should consider its own unique circumstances when navigating the following tuning decisions:
- **Choosing a price:** revnets with infrequent and shallow price decreases leave room for more equal access over time to entice newcomers, but may lack energy from incumbent participants whose contributions and timing are less distinguished.
- **Choosing a cash out tax:** revnets with a larger cash out tax reward more committed participants, but give everyone less access to liquidity and loans.
- **Choosing token distribution:** revnets with splits or automints can acknowledge the non-financial forms of participation which are often the subjects around which they revolve, but also can create scoped management burdens requiring more trust.

There is no such thing as an a priori ideal tuning of a revnets rules, just as there was never an apriori perfect Bitcoin halvening timeframe or fixed supply number. A successful tuning is one that manages to convey the right incentives – either on purpose or on accident – to stimulate growth over time.

Three effects to visually note:

1. The scheduled $TOKEN price increases can cause exponential decay in issuance potential:
<img width="1657" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5632ca24-96ab-49f8-800c-47ac3be04481">

2. A cash out tax (`r`) effects the available reclaimable amount from the revnet at any given time on a curve depending only on outstanding token supply and total funds in the revnet (`reclaimable amount = cashed out $TOKEN amount * revnet balance / total $TOKEN supply * (r + cashed out $TOKEN amount * (1-r) / total $TOKEN supply`):
<img width="1443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2c4d2cb-5eb9-457d-a6a8-edbd40bbb03f">

3. The $TOKEN price and the cash out price together form a price ceiling and a price floor that an AMM can service between:
<img width="1016" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c3179c-2d25-4fd6-9c59-26de248022b6">

#### Loans

Since each revnet's $TOKENs have a cash out value that can never decrease, the tokens make for great loan collateral. Instead of cashing out, $TOKEN holders might prefer to use them as collateral for a loan they can pay back over time to access their $TOKENs again. The loan provider can cash out the collateral if the loan isn't paid back.

Revnets themselves offer these loans to its $TOKEN holders by lending out its asset base in exchange for holding onto the borrower's $TOKENs as collateral. This allows for overcollateralized loans at a risk-free rate while also generating revenue by putting its assets to work, a win ultimately for the revnet $TOKEN's cash out price. Each revnet has loans as a baked in revenue model by default.

$TOKEN holders are incentivized to prefer that their revnet loans out as much as possible, as each new loan permanently increases the cash out value of all $TOKENs. Every $TOKEN holder has equal access to loans at all times, at a rate equivalent to the cash out rate. 

Loans can last a maximum of 10 years. A borrower can choose to pay over time at a rate that linearly increases as the loan duration approaches 10 years, choose to pre-pay for the loan at half the cost, or mixed – prepay for some duration and continue on paying full price if its still not paid off. This revenue goes to the revnet itself, issuing or buying back more $TOKENs for the borrower. 

Loans from all revnets also incur a 2.5% $NANA fee and a 0.5% $REV fee, in addition to the afore mentioned fee charged to the revnet being borrowed from.

### 2.3 $REV

RRG is setting up $REV's revnet rules attempting to emphasize the following principles: 
- **Simple:** Its rules play out in 3 stages that should be easy to think about, with occasional important shifts that feel ceremonial.
- **Self-owned growth:** It should make sure all participants who will sustain its growth – investors, builders, storytellers, fans, donors, fee-paying retail consumers – feel like it benefits them.
- **Clear incentives, from startup to scale:** It should make both elders and newcomers feel like it acknowledges risks and contributions over time.
- **Just flexible enough:** RRG will steward a meaningful token split affording it some operational flexibility, which is a responsibility it can minimize and revoke down the road. It will assume some trust from supporters.

#### $REV stage 1

_Price increases by 50% every 90 days. 38% of issuance and buybacks to Revnet Research Group. Automint an initial supply to acknowledge pre-net work. Cashing out leaves some money on the table._

> RRG can shape the split distribution within the hardwired 38% over time (or relinquish the power), and will receive the initial automint. Prospectively, the 38% split will have 30% routed to `rrg.eth`, and 8% to `dao.jbx.eth`. The 69,000 automint will have 25,000 sent to `dao.jbx.eth` (JuiceboxDAO), 10,000 to `breadfruit.eth`, 10,000 to `filipv.eth`, 10,000 to `codalabs.eth`, 4,000 to `openesquire.eth`, 2,000 to `kmacb.eth`, 2,000 to `0xba5ed.eth`, 2,000 to `noobwonder.eth`, 2,000 to [Peel](https://juicebox.money/@peel), 1,000 to `drgorilla.eth`, 1,000 to `peacenode.eth`, 500 to [Juicecast](https://juicebox.money/@juicecast), and 500 to LJ.

| **Cash out tax**   | No change. Small (0.2).    

> Prospectively, the 10% split will always be burnt.

#### Accessibility

Anyone can pay into $REV at any time. It is also hardwired to receive a 2.5% network fee whenever someone cashes out from any revnet – thousands of digital vending machines plugged into the $REV vending machine. Both one-off payments and fees are treated the same and used to either issue new $REV from its revnet or buyback $REV from the market, depending on which is a better deal. 

We want to especially encourage investors to join who see potential use for revnets in other areas of their portfolios, and who can help the adoption of the revnet standard. 

Both token-comfortable people interacting directly from their favorite EVM blockchain, and token-curious people interacting using traditional methods through RF1, are welcome. 

### 2.4 Revnet Research Group (RRG)

We'll use an LLC named Revnet Research Group to support the revnet ecosystem and help it interface with conventional tech and finance.

We think it's important for RRG to set an example of how a corporate partnership can be successful as a scoped subcomponent of a public onchain revnet structure, in this case $REV. 

#### RRG Mission

RRG will serve the growth and sustainability of open internet economies through revnets. We think its realistic to expect $1 billion of assets locked in revnets in 4 years.

In the short term, we need to make sure the upcoming revnets have a great chance at being successful, delivering revnets as the clear vision of how wealth will be most productively created and distributed in our future. 

#### Bottom line

RRG will achieve its mission in three ways: build and market a great [revnet.app](https://revnet.app) – the trusted web link to browse and participate in revnets through, leverage its $REV balance towards marketing and ecosystem development, and accelerate new revnets with consulting, funding, tools, and staff.

RRG will also have leverage to charge fees when facilitating access to revnets for traditional institutions.

#### Structure 

RRG, LLC will be a Delaware-based entity primarily engaged in investing in $REV tokens and the development of the #REV ecosystem. The LLC will be a single member LLC: Jango. Given its member-managed structure, these individuals will actively participate in the management and decision-making processes of the LLC, ensuring a hands-on approach to both investment strategies and ecosystem development. The primary business activities will include acquiring and holding $REV tokens, as well as fostering growth and innovation within the Revnet ecosystem through various initiatives and partnerships.

#### Onchain management 

Onchain, RRG will manage its $REV with a 3/5 multisig at `rrg.eth`. The multisig is controlled by:

- `breadfruit.eth` (jango)
- `0xBa5ed.eth` (0xBa5ed)
- `noobwonder.eth` (nowonder)
- `johnnyd.eth` (johnnyd)
- `dao.jbx.eth` (JuiceboxDAO)
- `openesquire.eth` (Robert Leonhard)

#### Offchain management

Offchain management of the corporation will be led by Jango, with legal counsel from Robert and with help from other members of the Juicebox community, including 0xBa5ed, JohnnyD, Wraeth, Nowonder – among those most knowledgable about Juicebox smart contracts and client-side SDKs.

[Jango](https://jango.eth.sucks) cofounded and has developed the [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money) protocol to support organizational money experiments on the public internet over the past 4 years.

Robert Leonhard is the co-founder of [Open Esquire](https://openesq.tech), a group of legal engineers serving Ethereum projects and many Juicebox projects.

0xBa5ed has been working on Juicebox since 2022, helping to author and secure the protocol's smart contracts, with a focus on its cross-chain aspects.

JohnnyD has been working on Juicebox since 2022, helping write the juicebox.money ecosystem explorer.

Wraeth has been working on Juicebox since 2022, helping write the juicebox.money ecosystem explorer.

Nowonder has been working on Juicebox since 2023, helping to write a complete testing suit for the JuiceboxV4 protocol and all of its contractual components.


#### Spend

RRG will use the $REV it earns to support the launch, security, and distribution of revnet.app and associated revnets. We will 

1. staff jango (project/contract/tech lead).
2. staff 0xBa5ed and Nowonder as dev tooling and contract security leads.
3. staff JohnnyD and Wraeth as client-side leads for revnet.app (since aeolian will be handing off development once deployed).
4. staff kmac (bizdev).
5. retain rob (legal).

[Aeolian](https://x.com/aeolianeth) has been working on Juicebox since November 2021, and leading the development of [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) since 2022. Aeolian also makes essential tools to support the Juicebox ecosystem: [juicescan.io](https://www.juicescan.io), the [Juicebox SDK](https://github.com/Bananapus/juice-sdk-v4), and the in-progress [revnet.app](https://revnet.app).

[Filip](https://filip.world) has been working on Juicebox since November 2021, focusing on documentation, off-chain tools and services, and frontend development, as well as directly supporting many Juicebox project creators.

[KMac](https://kmacb.eth.limo) is an experienced entrepreneur who has been contributing to multiple DAOs including Solace, Purple, Juicebox and Defifa.

The technical and product todos include:
- iterate on revnet.app to best serve revnet participation and creation.
- standby for risk mitigation as the contracts gain legitimacy through use. iterate if necessary.
- build dev tools that make revnets easier to integrate within financial and white-labeled applications.

The marketing todos include:
- tell the revnet story.
- support the success of the initial cohort of revnets by telling each of their stories. See section 3 for examples.
- create a trustworthy brand.
- run a "This Ad is funded by a revnet" campaign, and other concepts.

The partnership todos include:
- make the case to founders, DAOs, and VCs that they should be structuring their deals as revnets.
- mediate between offchain interactions and onchain revnet transactions on behalf of traditional partners. 
- build relationships with the support structures of each blockchain revnets operate on.

### 2.5 RF1

There will also be a Rev Fund 1, LLC, a Delaware-based private investment fund structured as a limited liability company. Its primary focus will be on investing in $REV projects, with an investment mandate managed by a registered investment advisor (RIA). The fund will target private investors who meet the standard accreditation and qualification criteria, complying with the 3(c)(1) exemption under the Investment Company Act. Capital will be raised through a private placement offering, with investors committing to specified minimum investment amounts. The RIA managing the fund will charge a 2% management fee, ensuring dedicated oversight and strategic investment in the $REV ecosystem. This fee structure aligns with industry standards, providing transparency and incentivizing effective fund management.

More about RF1 soon.

### 2.7 Decisions

You'll have to do your own further research to decide if you should invest in $REV, $JBX, RF1, or others.

In summary:

- For those comfortable accessing tokens onchain, $JBX is a fixed-supply governance token which has been on the market for several years – the revnet project and several others were informally incubated from within Juicebox DAO. It is expected to receive a split of $REV issuance and buybacks from RRG, likely making it a good proxy to build ongoing exposure to $REV's revenue growth – albeit subject to RRG's discretion and to the risks associated with Juicebox DAO's governance process. You can learn more [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/).
- Also for those onchain, $REV benefits from revnet revenue growth without governance proxies, while also aligning fully with RRG and providing direct operating capital to RRG.
- RRG LLC is an operational group whose mission is to grow $REV. It is not directly investable.
- RF1 LLC is the only current way to access the ecosystem for participants who don't want to access tokens directly onchain. RF1 will facilitate revnet interactions on traditional investors' behalf, albeit for a management fee.
- $NANA benefits from broad Juicebox V4 growth, including but not limited to revnets. It welcomes direct participation without proxies, though it will be largely held by Juicebox DAO. $JBX is certainly a better vehicle for broad ecosystem exposure if you're comfortable with its current governance risks.

## Part 3 – What do they look like?

### 3.1 Overview

There are three categories of revnet businesses that we foresee in the near term:
- **Direct sales:** These revnets' tokens are sought directly from the usage of applications that take fees, or from the sales of goods and services. These can be onchain applications which hardcode and automate the routing of funds to the revnet, or offchain applications which rely on an intermediary entity to manage engagement with the revnet and token distribution on users' behalf.
- **Subscription fees:** These revnets' tokens are sought because they permit access to certain functionalities onchain or offchain.
- **Memetic:** These revnets' tokens are sought because holders believe in the network's capacity to aggregate attention and cultural relevance, or because the tokens serve a secondary purpose like signaling loyalty.

We expect these business models to be initially used by three main categories of organizations:
- **Onchain:** Revnets with zero split percentages, or split percentages going to onchain multisigs and onchain DAOs with no offchain organizational considerations. 
- **Hybrid:** Revnets with a split percent operated by a traditional for-profit or non-profit corporation or association.
- **Campaign:** Revnets with a near-100% split percentage, useful for ongoing fundraises that prefer access to all the capital for affecting a specific set of causes.

A revnet can belong to any number of these categories, and grow into others over time as new ideas emerge and market preferences shift. $REV, for example, is best described within the "direct sales" category because it benefits from fees taken directly within the smart contract routines, and is a "hybrid" structure with RRG as the split operator.

There are likely other strategies for using revnets that we've yet to explore in depth.

### 3.2 Cartoon hypotheticals

Below are some made up examples to supplement the above.

#### $MY_TRACKS

An artist could use a revnet to receive revenues from sales of its records, splitting most $MY_TRACKS to themselves for access to revenues and loans, and some to the record's buyers. The $MY_TRACKS will always be backed by the revenue at the minimum, and can also be speculated on with AMMs up to the revnet's current issuance price. This gives collectors liquidity that scales at the rate of distribution.


#### $SAVE_THE_BANANAS

An ongoing campaign could use a revnet to receive donations, with a large 99% split automatically shared between a few different organizations that support the desired outcome. The 1% little bit of $SAVE_THE_BANANAS can float to donors, useful for an immediate rebate, or a liquid community meme asset. 

#### $FILIPS_NAIL_SALON

A nail shop could accept crypto payment to its revnet, with a fairly large 80% split to Filip used to run the shop. The 20% of $FILIPS_NAIL_SALON is the growth budget that rewards Filip's clients with incentives to keep coming back and spread the word and. Filip could also take cash and interact with the revnet on clients' behalf, keeping a spreadsheet of how many $FILIPS_NAIL_SALON each cash-paying customer has. Maybe some day they'll come to you with a wallet address to claim them from you.

#### $KMACS_BIG_IDEA

KMACs startup could use a revnet to fundraise, perhaps keeping a 50% split for operating costs. This lets investors measure their contributions maintain some liquidity with a clear path to growth. Anyone – KMAC, investors, community – can stand up new revenue sources routed to the revnet for everyone's benefit. If KMACs startup proves successful, he can opt to relinquish its role as split operator to an automated module that redistributes the split to stakers of $KMACS_BIG_IDEA. If the startup proves to be a failure, KMAC can burn any unused $TOKENs to make more funds available to investors, and investors can cash out as desired. KMAC could also hand the split operator role back to the investors.

#### $JETFLIX

An airplane exclusive subscription video service could use a revnet to issue tokens that prove wanna-be viewers paid the price to watch, with a tiny issuance price reduction over time. I pay 0.001 ETH and get 100 $JETFLIX => i try to watch the movie Airplane which costs 50 $JETFLIX => the system keeps track that I have used 50 $JETFLIX, which it can compare to my balance at the time i next want to pay for a movie. In a year, i might instead need to pay I pay 0.0015 ETH for 100 $JETFLIX. This gives users incentive to buy more access early, and support the ecosystems growth as they use the system.

#### $BOOP

10,000 $BOOP per ETH, halvening every 14 days. 1% split to your favorite onchain cause. pointless otherwise.

#### $CHAIN_GAME

An onchain game can route a fee from its smart contracts to a revnet, splitting a fee to the game developer community and the rest to fee payers, guarenteed.

### 3.3 Upcoming revnets

Below are some other revnets we're helping launch this next year within each of these categories. They are game changers.

### $NANA
|      |        |
|------|--------|
| **Site** | [https://nana.eth.sucks](https://nana.eth.sucks) |
| **Business model category**  |  Direct sales |
| **Organizational category**  |  Onchain |
| **Value prop**  |  Captures revenues from the omnichain Juicebox V4's 2.5% fee. |
| **$NANA distribution** | JuiceboxDAO will start out with a large initial supply. JuiceboxDAO will operate the split and retain a percentage of supply as $NANA tokens are issued or bought back. |
| **Big bet** | As the omnichain Juicebox V4 ecosystem comes online and growth moves to it from V3, $NANA will benefit increasingly from fee income across all chains. The protocol takes a 2.5% fee from payouts and redeemed tokens of all projects. |
| **Edge** | If open source protocols with fees outcompete free alternatives and if governance is a burden to productivity, $NANA and JuiceboxDAO are uniquely positioned to capture revenue that regeneratively grows the wealth of its open source financial system. |
| **Risks** | Unlike V3, V4 has no TVL and has not facilitated high volume transactions. |

### $BANNY
|      |        |
|------|--------|
| **Site** | [https://banny.eth.sucks](https://banny.eth.sucks) |
| **Business model category**  |  Direct sales |
| **Organizational category**  |  Hybrid |
| **Value prop**  |  Captures revenues from the [Banny shop](https://shop.banny.eth.sucks). |
| **$BANNY distribution** | Banny Looks, LLC (BLLC) & JuiceboxDAO will each start out with some initial supply. BLLC will retain a percentage of supply as $BANNY are issued or bought back. |
| **Big bet** | Banny's relatability and bluntness can make him/her a modern internet fashion icon, and the BLLC production team is ripe to make it happen. If Banny successfully reflects internet culture back to itself, making modern tech culture's ambitions and hypocrisy relatable through the propagation of fashion, stories, and values, Banny can be the hero of post-platform internet fashion. <br><br>In turn, JuiceboxDAO, $NANA, and $REV benefit from the productive use of its protocols and the distribution of a Banny brand that's rooted in Juicebox lore, from V4 activity that adds value to $NANA, and revnet activity that adds value to $REV.  |
| **Edge** | If character-based storytelling is key to relatability, $BANNY and BLLC are uniquely positioned to distribute the values that Banny has grown synonymous with over the years, while making the novel token-based concepts it's associated with approachable. |
| **Risks** | There's a sea of content out there, it'll likely take persistence and increasingly better writing to break through. |

### $SUCKS
|      |        |
|------|--------|
| **Site** | [https://eth.sucks](https://eth.sucks) |
| **Business model category**  |  Memetic |
| **Organizational category**  |  Onchain |
| **Value prop**  |  Captures memetic energy from the distribution of .eth.sucks links. |
| **$SUCKS distribution** | TBD. |
| **Big bet** | IPFS-based peer-to-peer websites are more resilient than centralized alternatives, making them an ideal fit to interact with permissionless smart contracts. These websites can be surfaced from any number of proxy links (eth.limo, eth.sucks, etc), but projects will usually commit to identifying with one such link in their marketing collateral. By choosing eth.sucks, they are propagating the $SUCKS meme, which in turn supports the proxy infrastructure's optimization and maintenance. |
| **Edge** | If links are where the innovation rubber meets the online distribution road, $SUCKS and the community supporting it are uniquely positioned to capture and recycle the memetic energy contained in domain sharing, while promoting decentralized values in a traditionally centralized value-capture bottleneck. |
| **Risks** | Maintaining an ENS proxy can be time consuming, expensive, and hard to automate. |


### $CROPTOP
|      |        |
|------|--------|
| **Site** | [https://croptop.eth.sucks](https://croptop.eth.sucks) |
| **Business model category**  |  Direct sales |
| **Organizational category**  |  Onchain |
| **Value prop**  |  Collects a 2.5% fee from mints made from Croptop templates, a simple IPFS-based peer-to-peer website template with content feeds and revenue streams baked in. |
| **Big bet** | In order to be widely adopted, IPFS-based peer-to-peer websites need to be easy to deploy and easy to attach to ENS names. The croptop Mac app fulfills this ease. <br><br>As the template is increasingly used to onboard folks to the decentralized website stack and serve their content, $CROPTOP will benefit from a 2.5% fee taken on all mints originating from it. |
| **Edge** | If content propegation benefits from being collectable, $CROPTOP and the community supporting it are uniquely positioned to remove barriers from publishing and minting across any number of blockchains. |
| **Risks** | Croptop templates can be adapted and served as folks wish, there is no way to enforce the fee at a programmatic level. |


### $DEFIFA
|      |        |
|------|--------|
| **Site** | [https://defifa.net](https://defifa.net) |
| **Business model category**  |  Direct sales |
| **Organizational category**  |  Hybrid |
| **Value prop**  |  Captures revenues from defifa prediction games. |
| **$DEFIFA distribution** | Defifa Ballkids & JuiceboxDAO will each start out with some initial supply. Defifa Ballkids will retain a percentage of supply as its issued or bought back. |
| **Big bet** | People enjoy playing games, making predictions, and being a part of cultural moments. Defifa allows prediction games to resolve based only on community engagement, no oracles necessary. The lack of a need for oracles means games can be created around any cultural moment at any time. Games can then be used as a fundraising or revenue component of other networks, adding dimension and interactivity to existing networks. <br><br>As more games are played, $DEFIFA will benefit from a 2.5% fee taken on all paid out funds originating from them.   |
| **Edge** | If the need for oracles reduce the landscape of playable prediction games onchain, $DEFIFA and the Defifa Research Group are uniquely positioned to open up new niche prediction markets for communities to play that benefit players involved. |
| **Risks** | Defifa games lean on social consensus to determine outcomes. Games resolve based on the outcome agreed on by players, not necessary the actual real world outcome. Incentives are designed to align these two outcomes, but there are no guarantees.   |

### $NANCE
|      |        |
|------|--------|
| **Site** | [https://nance.app](https://nance.app) |
| **Business model category**  |  Subscription fees |
| **Organizational category**  |  Onchain |
| **Value prop**  |  Brokers access to the nance service. |
| **$NANCE distribution** | TBD. |
| **Big bet** | Onchain organizations often rely on governance processes to make decisions regarding shared resources. Nance offers a unique take on governance that encourages scheduled deliberation and voting periods, adding structure that standardizes expectations therefore minimizing risks of neglect or abuse. <br><br>As more organizations use Nance to facilitate their governance process, $NANCE will benefit from a subscription fee that keeps each organization's instance of the service running.   |
| **Edge** | If tokenized governance continues to be a sought-after coordination exercise for online groups, Nance has a strong track record of helping organizations manage millions of dollars and is uniquely positioned to guide folks towards best practices that encourage participation while avoiding pitfalls of power struggle. |
| **Risks** | Nance runs a server-based service, using crypto only for its users' data backups and for its own business model operations. This interaction of web2 and web3 is novel and lacks best practices, we're making intricate decisions involving tradeoffs as we develop tools such as Nance and revnets.     |

### 3.4 FAQ

#### How would revnets work in the context of traditional capitalization structures?

Revnets can complement and enhance traditional equity structures, making them applicable not only to crypto-native companies but also to more conventional corporations and organizations.

Corporations and associations like C-Corps, LLCs, UNAs, DAOs, and 501(c)(3) nonprofits can benefit from their own revnet by involving customers and community members as active participants in their growth. The revnet can be used to drive new revenue streams, increase engagement, and aligning the success of the revnet with its own financial performance.

These organizations can act as both token holders and split operators. As a token holder, a corporation benefits directly from the growth of the revnet, as its tokens appreciate in value. As a split operator, the organization can determine how much control it wants over the token supply:

- **Full control:** The organization could set up the revnet to receive 100% of the tokens, allowing it to maintain full control over the token distribution and benefits.
- **No Control:** Alternatively, it could choose to receive 0% of the tokens, relinquishing control to the broader community to encourage decentralized growth.
- **Partial control:** The organization might opt for a middle ground, controlling a portion of the token supply for a set period.

This flexibility allows traditional organizations to tailor the revnet to their specific needs and goals. Meanwhile, the revnet remains resiliant to being rugged by the entity, as doing so will incure the exit tax and benefit remaining holders most. Everyone involved is incentivizes to grow the revnet, even if there also exits other incentives alongside to grow a for-profit or non-profit traditional organization – in ideal cases these go hand-in-hand.

Revnet Research Group (RRG) exemplifies this approach by taking a 40% split of the $REV revnet. This means RRG retains a significant stake in the revnet's growth while leaving 60% of the tokens to the broader community, incentivizing collective participation and shared success.

#### What are the risks I should be aware of?

**Smart contract risk**: Revnets are built using the Juicebox V4 protocol which can exist across multiple EVM blockchains. Though it is a fork and iteration of Juicebox V3 that secures tens of millions of dollars in locked value on Ethereum mainnet, there is the possibility of smart contract bugs that cause the system to collapse. JuiceboxDAO has spent the better part of the last year's time and budget on testing, documentation, and hiring third party auditors, though it is always encouraging more eyes on the open source code base. Ultimately, smart contract security comes from production lindiness while managing funds at risk.

**Organizational risk**: $REV runs on its own and has no organizational risk. RRG and $JBX on the other hand, do have organizational risks exposed through the same governance means that affords them certain flexibilities to pursue emergent opportunities. Engaging with either RRG or $JBX should warrant due diligence to understand how decisions have been made and how they'll likely continue to be made within those organizations.

**Market risk**: RRG is a for-profit organization that will look to build its $REV exposure and harness its specialization in revnets to become successful. We believe revnets are marketable and can outcompete alternative organizational structures, but this is an unproven thesis with projects outside of our own. Choosing an organizational token structure is a big decision that each project tends to make only once and stick to forever afterward. It's hard to become the standard structure, but once the standard is set it tends to stick. At first, the revnet sales cycle will likely be long, we'll want to observe how the structure provides value both as a supportive component of already-existing organizations, and as the core piece of new orgs starting up. We'll lead the way with great examples of successful revnets folks can look up, starting with $REV, whose energy will help us reach critical mass.

**Immutability risk**: Though a revnet's immutability is its core value proposition, some might also view this as a risk. A revnet is impossible to course correct once deployed and legitimacy has been established. Mainly, the $REV specification that determines issuance policy could turn out to not motivate activity as much as intended. A perfect revnet configuration is hard to know ahead of time, and there aren't many levers that expose control within its ruleset – like bitcoin, the hardcoded rules can only teleologically be deemed productive if the network proves itself in competition with forked alternatives. The two variables that do offer control and flexibility within the $REV revnet specs are the 38% split that rrg.eth will operate, and the autominted tokens. RRG can play a part in reorienting priorities using the split in order to stimulate some desired behavior, and can reasonably expect the autominted token holders to act in the best interest of the network's growth.

#### Which blockchains?

Revnets are built using the Juicebox V4 protocol, which can extend to any new blockchain that can accomodate its "Sucker" interfaces. We're starting on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base because the Ethereum ecosystem prioritizes immutability and decentralizations more than most, they have the most financial liquidity, and they extend most simply from the previous versions of Juicebox which was Ethereum mainnet only. In order to deploy on Solana, for example, we'd first want to build a Solana version of Juicebox V4 – doable but not a priority right now. 

#### I'm not sure exactly how revnets might fit my project, can I bounce ideas off someone?

Yes absolutely, each project can have unique and important properties to design towards, and in the beginning we don't have many examples to follow. The Revnet telegram is a great place to reach out @revnet_eth, or discord at https://discord.gg/vhVxwh8aD9. If revnets don't turn out to fit your needs, you can always use the juicebox protocol directly for a more hands-on project that can be adapted over time.

## Overview

Technological breakthroughs push entrepreneurs, capital providers, and regulators to create and use new financial structures that fit the contours of progress. It isn't a coincidence that [joint-stock companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company) were the defining structure of the mercantile era, that [limited liability corporations](https://www.jstor.org/stable/764920) played the same role during the Industrial Revolution, or that today's Silicon Valley startups are defined by the use of broad-based equity compensation like [Y-Combinator's Safe financing documents](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/).[^1]

This decade has seen major progress across many technological domains. Some of these domains, like genomics, are well-served by traditional corporate-stock models. But for many internet-native businesses, especially crypto projects who champion open source and are innovating on internet-based contracts, traditional models have clear shortcomings for entrepreneurs, consumers, and capital providers alike. Several major players, like Uniswap, ENS, Maker, and Compound have tried to address these shortcomings by combining standard for-profit companies with tradable tokens and experimental govrenance structures like DAOs. In practice, this has often lead to vulnerabilities from power struggle.[^2] 

When even these combined structures fall short, it's often due to a lack of transparency, misguided expectations, or misaligned incentives. We need a better structure. 

When used effectively, [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/) do offer the means of a path forward by providing:

- **Immediacy**: They encode sophisticated financial relationships between global participants which would be impractical to manage with traditional contracts.
- **Clarity**: They allow for ownership and access rules that can't be subjectively misinterpretted.
- **Certainty**: They express clear rules which cannot be broken, as opposed to the soft guarantees of legal agreements (which can be difficult to enforce).
- **Auditability**: They are impossible to hide, simplifying diligence for all participants.

Shaping smart contracts, [the Juicebox V4 protocol](https://github.com/nana-core) does standardize a simple set of levers expressing financial relationships over time between builders, organizations, investors, donors, retail customers, and whoever else across border and blockchains.

By using these onchain tools of today, recognizing the progressing legal landscape, and witnessing a need for a reliable and productive structure that serves as the backbone of digital organizations, we were led to create *revnets*. Revnets are a **fully pre-configured** financial structure – although they can evolve over time, they do so according to rules which are set in place at the time of their creation. Think of it like a fancy Bitcoin halvening rule. This means:

- **Governance-free**: Governance inefficiencies and takeovers of funds – among the most common failure modes for DAOs – are impossible.
- **Management-free**: Revnets operate autonomously, according to their pre-configured rules.
- **Deterministic**: Investors, builders, community, and customers know that each revnet's rules will be enforced programmatically from start to finish.
- **Familiar**: Transparency and diligence are simple. Once one revnet's workings makes sense, all revnets make sense.

In the same way that standardized traditional legal agreements allow investors to fund offchain startups without adding unnecessary risk each time, a standardized (but configurable) onchain financial structure like revnets, encoded through smart contracts, allows capital providers to confidently fund a wide variety of cryptocurrency projects without the need to separately audit each one's scheme and code.

## Thesis

We're doubling down on revnets as a vision of how wealth will be most productively created and distributed in our future characterized by digital networks and cryptographic identities. We're after partners to help propel this thesis forward.

## Context

[In July 2021](https://docs.juicebox.money/updates/juicebox-deployed/) Jango and Peri launched [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money) – a programmable financial model which allows anyone to accept and manage funds, issue tokens and NFTs to supporters, and offer hard guarantees, without third parties, secured by its smart contracts, with revenues used to back the $JBX token and community itself as a project on the protocol.

As of June 2024, Juicebox has facilitated $185,539,642 in ETH payments to 1,331 projects. Importantly, Juicebox has been built and maintained by a group of internet anons organized under JuiceboxDAO, which is itself using the Juicebox model. At its core, the experiment has been to create tools that facilitate business models of the future, starting with $JBX.

## Problem

Over the last decade, we've seen compelling consumer crypto offerings emerge, but few have struck [onchain](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#on-chain) sustainability. Despite their audience, many organizations continue relying only on traditional cap tables, term sheets, payrolls, and rent-seeking fee structures because productive and safe onchain alternatives haven't been well-demonstrated. Others stick to a public goods narrative that sidesteps conversations about risks and incentives altogether. 

Even the best onchain organizational expirements still suffer from governance and management risks that take dedicated attention to make worthwhile. A few meaningful governance processes can be great, but at scale we need more sustainable and regenerative value-capture that doesn't introduce more and more governance. We need a structure that unlocks the value of capitalizing fundraises and revenues onchain, but doesn't create new fragilities that require perpetual attention.

## Big bet

We think revnets – an encoded expression of the juicebox language – can help millions of startups become global movements, high net-worth interconnected economies, and retail-owned brands that outcompete traditional alternatives.

<!-- TODO: Should we have a graphic here? -->

## Revnet Research Group (RRG)

We'd like to begin a dedicated Revnet Research Group (RRG) corporation to support the revnet ecosystem and help it interface with conventional tech and finance sectors.

We think it's important for RRG to set an example of how a corporate entity can be successful as a scoped subcomponent of a broader onchain revnet structure.

### Mission

Bet on revnets to encourage the growth and sustainability of open internet economies.

### Bottom line

RRG accumulates $REV and adds value to it in three ways: making web tools that let anyone browse and participate in revnets, building dev tools that make revnets easier to integrate, and accelerating new projects as revnets.

The $REV revnet receives a 2.5% network fee whenever someone cashes out from any revnet. The fee is used to either issue or buyback $REV, depending on which is a better deal. RRG receives a portion of these $REV issuance and buybacks as the fees come in. (See [$REV](#rev) below).

### Pitch to investors

We’re selling 10% of the company Revnet Research Group at a $50m valuation.

We will use some of the money to staff jango, filip, aeolian, and kmac, and the bulk to support the launch and marketing of revnet.app and associated revnets.

### Fundraising operations

We will use a SAFE.

<!-- TODO: This is YC Safe and not Gnosis, right? We should specify which kind (post-money MFN no cap no discount?) and combine with the prior section. -->

### Structure 

RRG is a Delaware C corporation – 51% owned by Jango, 39% reserved for staff, 10% sold to investors.

### Onchain management 

Onchain, RRG will manage its $REV with a 3/6 multisig at `rrg.rev.eth`. The multisig is controlled by:

- `breadfruit.eth` (jango)
- `filipv.eth` (Filip)
- `codalabs.eth` (Aeolian)
- `kmac.eth` (Kmac)
- `dao.jbx.eth` (JuiceboxDAO)
- `openesquire.eth` (Robert Leonhard)

### Offchain management

Offchain management of the corporation will be led by Jango, Filip, Aeolian, KMac, Robert, and other members of the Juicebox community:

[Jango](https://jango.eth.sucks) founded and has developed the [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money) protocol to support organizational money experiments on the public internet.

[Filip](https://filip.world) has been working on Juicebox since November 2021, focusing on documentation, off-chain tools and services, and frontend development, as well as directly supporting many Juicebox project creators.

[Aeolian](https://x.com/aeolianeth) has been working on Juicebox since November 2021, and leading the development of [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) since 2022. Aeolian also makes essential tools to support the Juicebox ecosystem: [juicescan.io](https://www.juicescan.io), the [Juicebox SDK](https://github.com/Bananapus/juice-sdk-v4), and the in-progress [revnet.app](https://revnet.app).

[KMac](https://kmacb.eth.limo) is an experienced entrepreneur who has been contributing to multiple DAOs including Solace, Purple, Juicebox and Defifa.

Robert Leonhard is the co-founder of [Open Esquire](https://openesq.tech), a group of legal engineers serving Ethereum projects and many Juicebox projects.

### Ideal partners

We need partners who want to help with growth strategies. We (folks from around the Juicebox community) are about to deploy Juicebox v4 and the first [cohort of production revnets](#examples-of-revnets). We're looking for partners who believe in the mission, believe in the team, and can help make this launch chapter successful.

### Roadmap

1. Grow by facilitating growth. Help revnets accept more money by building great products like [revnet.app](https://www.revnet.app) and offering services to offchain institutions which allow them to participate in revnets. 
2. In 8 years, once there are hundreds of billion dollar networks running as revnets, IPO to give conventional financial markets exposure to $REV.
3. In 15 years, consider cashing out of $REV positions and offering buybacks – doing so will consolidate the $REV network's value towards remaining holders. 

## $REV

$REV runs on its own as a revnet according to the rules below. RRG is a token holder alongside other token holders and has no special powers. Anyone can participate in $REV at any time.

### Anatomy of a revnet

Each revnet has a token and is defined in stages. Each stage specifies a set of rules which dictate how the revent operates:

- **Duration:** How long does the stage last? A revnet’s final stage lasts forever.
- **Starting price:** How much does it cost to buy a single token when the stage begins? The payment's value stays within the revnet and can only be accessed by token holders who cash out.
- **Price increase:** How frequently, and by how much, does the token's price increase within the stage?
- **Split:** What percentage of token issuance (and buybacks) are set aside for a list of recipients, and which address is the split operator? The split operator can add, remove, or modify recipients from that list, changing how the split is allocated within the stage.
- **Automint:** How many tokens get minted to a list of recipients at the start of the stage? This functions like a "pre-mint".
- **Cash out tax:** How much does the revnet's reclaimable value per token increase each a token holders burns their tokens to cash out?

If token holders add liquidity to an [AMM](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/uniswap-protocol#order-book-vs-amm) and it offers a better price than the revnet, the revnet will route incoming payments to that market instead of issuing new tokens. The revnet's split is applied to these buybacks as well.

Revnets issue new tokens until the market naturally provides supply and demand for the token, meaning revnets get started without leaking value and sustain efficient growth over time.

Built using Juicebox v4, revnets can grow to accept money on new [EVM-compatible networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) as they emerge, and offer cash outs on those networks too. Holders can move their tokens between chains, and when they do, the revnet automatically moves funds to back those tokens to maintain those tokens' value.

### $REV stage 1

_Inaugural 77 day $REV sale ⏩. Your payments are worth 2.5x what they'll be worth in stage 2. Mint the first of two batches of tokens to honor pre-launch work._

- **Duration:** 77 days.

- **Price increase:** None, since there's no more issuance.
- **Split:** None.
- **Cash out tax:** No change. Medium-high (0.6).

## Legal

Each revnet’s rules are defined up front, and all transactions are public. Once a revnet is deployed, no manager has the power to change how it works, no supervisor has special backdoor access, and no authority can stop it. There is no managerial effort attached to an expectation of profit.

Now is the time to learn from the legal outcomes of the past few years and bet on deterministic mechanisms where no entity can change or control the rules once deployed, and where all information is publicly auditable.

RRG has it's own managerial efforts and is therefore selling structured access to a C corporation through a SAFE, but only engages with the $REV economy as a token holder.

<!-- TODO: We should add pre-money/post-money to the SAFE above. Also, we should just use "safe", though it also implies gnosis. -->

## Investor FAQ

### Should I invest in RRG, $REV, or...?

There are three core entities in play: $REV, RRG Corporation, and JuiceboxDAO ($JBX). According to the $REV specs above, RRG and JuiceboxDAO are both expected to receive a split of $REV issuance and buybacks, making them great proxies to build ongoing exposure to $REV's revenue growth – albeit subject to the risks associated with each entities' governance process.

- RRG Corporation is the only way to access the ecosystem for participants who don't want to access tokens directly onchain.
- For those comfortable accessing tokens onchain, $JBX is a fixed-supply governance token which has been on the market for several years, now utilizing its treasury to build out the Juicebox ecosystem – the revnet project and several others were informally incubated from within JuiceboxDAO. You can learn more [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/).
- Also for those onchain, it may be advantageous to build direct exposure to $REV to bet on revenue growth without proxies.

### What are the risks I should be aware of?

**Smart contract risk**: Revnets are built using the Juicebox V4 protocol which can exists across multiple EVM blockchains. Though it is a fork and iteration of Juicebox V3 that has secures tens of millions of dollars in locked value on Ethereum mainnet, there is the possibility of smart contract bugs that cause the system to collapse. JuiceboxDAO has spent the better part of the last year's time and budget on testing, documentation, and hiring third party auditors, though is always encouraging more eyes on the open source code base. Ultimately, smart contract security comes from production lindiness while managing funds at risk.

**Organizational risk**: $REV runs on its own and has no organizational risk. RRG and $JBX on the other hand, do have organizational risks exposed through the same governance means that affords them certain flexibilities to persue emergent opportunities. Engaging in either RRG or $JBX should warrent due diligence to understand how decisions have been made and how they'll likely continue to be made within those organizations.

**Market risk**: RRG is a for-profit organization that will look to build its $REV exposure and harness its specialization in revnets to bet on their success. We believe revnets are marketable and can outcompete alternative organizational structures, but this is an unproven thesis with projects outside of our own. Choosing an organizational token structure is a big decisions that each project tends to make only once and stick to forever afterward. It's hard to become the standard, but once the standard is set it tends to stick. At first, the revnet sales cycle will likely be long, we'll want to observe how the structure provides value both as a supportive component of already-existing organizations, and as the core piece of new orgs starting up. We'll lead the way with great examples of successful revnets folks can look up to.

[^2]: [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/overview) raises funds and employs developers under the for-profit Uniswap Labs, but the Uniswap protocol is governed by $UNI token voting. The competing interests of token holders and Uniswap Labs have led to a number of controversial decisions over Uniswap's fee switch, source code licensing, and cross-chain deployments. Other projects have faced similar controversies when the interests of token holders and developers have diverged.

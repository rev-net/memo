## Overview

Dominant organizational and financial models have always suited the technologies of their respective eras. It isn't a coincidence that [joint-stock companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company) were the defining structure of the mercantile era, that [limited liability corporations](https://www.jstor.org/stable/764920) played the same role during the Industrial Revolution, or that today's Silicon Valley startups are defined by the use of broad-based equity compensation like [Y-Combinator's Safe financing documents](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/).[^1]

In this era of internet-native businesses – AI, social, and crypto networks who champion open source and are publicly innovating on internet-native concepts – corporate-stock models of organization are anachronistic for entrepreneurs, capital providers, and consumers alike. We think revnets will emerge as the standard for internet businesses and economies. 

Revnets are a new financial structure made for capitalizing and growing internet-native money relationships. Think of it like Bitcoin's halvening rule – once deployed, its issuance policy leads to a guarenteed 21m supply over time. Instead of a fixed supply with periodic supply shocks, revnets enforce a certain other set of guarentees that promote enterprise growth, unchangeable after being deployed. 

Blackrock CEO Larry Finck and prominant others say the necessary and inevitable tokenization of everything will enhance the landscape of finance. We've known this for years, and now think revnets will participate in Larry's vision by being the most productive structure for both large organizations and small businesses to tokenize revenues and fundraises throughout the globe. Revnets are the SAFE and C-Corp agreements of this economy but 100x better.

Revnets can power all kinds of modern financial engagements to greater efficiency, from indy shopify stores, patreons, donations, all the way to corporate finance and high net worth brand management. The $REV network itself runs as a revnet, and captures 2.5% of each revnet's outflows from raised funds and revenues.

## Context

Those of us developing revnets have been contributors to the Ethereum ecosystem over the past 4 years, most notably having deployed and progressed the Juicebox protocol, the juicebox.money app, and the Juicebox DAO community driven by the $JBX network.

This is the same Juicebox with which Constitution DAO, Assage DAO, Shark DAO, Moon DAO, Cryo DAO, Juicebox DAO, the tornado cash developer legal defence fundraiser, and 1,331 other projects were established, facilitating over $185 million in ETH payments. We've been experiencing the demand for tokenized fundraising and revenue first hand, we know the tradeoffs of the tools at our disposal intimately well, and we know the culture and our role in it. We've been consistently one step ahead of the curve and steadfast with our values. 

Juicebox is revenue-generating public infrastructure that gives us a tokenized language for expressing various organizational finanial guarentees. It's evolution from V1 to V4 over the years has been a journey of refinement towards its current robust-yet-extensible form. Revnets are now the next step, a particular expression of this Juicebox language designed to reliably align interests between entrepreneurs, capital allocators, and retail customers alike. 

This team also understands the legal moment we are in when it comes to growing onchain organizations. We made revnets in part as a pre-requisite for many of our own upcoming projects in need of a tokenized financial engine that allows us to push forward with confidence. It is clear to us that:

1. We don't want to lean exclusively on traditional models which inevitably create misguided incentives for the types of internet-native networks we're working on.
2. We don't want to lean on governance-based DAOs. Major crypto players – Uniswap, ENS, Maker, Arbitrum, Compound to name a few – try to address these shortcomings by combining standard for-profit companies with tradable tokens and experimental govrenance structures. We've noticed that in practice, decentralized governance and capital allocation is hard and often leads to vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and power struggles. [^2]. We also don't want to manage more lawless revenue-generating governance-based DAO's like $JBX, one is gracious plenty.

Revnets are a **fully pre-configured** financial structure – although they can evolve over time, they do so according to rules which are set in place at the time of their creation. This means:

- **Governance-free**: Governance inefficiencies and takeovers of funds – among the most common failure modes for DAOs – are impossible.
- **Management-free**: Revnets operate autonomously, according to their pre-configured rules.
- **Deterministic**: Investors, builders, community, and customers know that each revnet's rules will be enforced programmatically from start to finish.
- **Familiar**: Transparency and diligence are simple. Once one revnet's workings makes sense, all revnets make sense.

Revnets also inherit the best properties of Ethereum and Juicebox V4:

- **Immediacy**: Encode sophisticated financial relationships between global participants which would be impractical to manage with traditional contracts.
- **Clarity**: Allow for ownership and access rules that can't be subjectively misinterpretted.
- **Certainty**: Express clearly scheduled rules which cannot be broken.
- **Auditability**: Impossible to hide, simplifying diligence for all participants.
- **Everywhere**: Allow organizations to tokenize their revenue and fundraises on any EVM blockchain, expanding to new ones as they emerge and prove their legitimacy.  

Ethereum is one of a kind, we have incredible respect and gratitude for the work of our peers that make what we do possible.
 
## Thesis

Revnets can power millions of startups to become global movements, high net-worth interconnected economies, and retail-owned brands that outcompete traditional private alternatives.

With revnets, the open internet will win _because_ it best serves creatives, builders, investors, and consumers alike.

We're open to partners who can help propel this thesis forward.

## Revnet Research Group (RRG)

We're starting a dedicated Revnet Research Group (RRG) LLC to support the revnet ecosystem and help it interface with conventional tech and finance sectors.

We think it's important for RRG to set an example of how a corporate entity can be successful as a scoped subcomponent of a public onchain revnet structure, in this case [$REV (see below)](#rev). 

### RRG Mission

Encourage the growth and sustainability of open internet economies – large and small – through revnets. We're shooting for $1 billion of assets locked in revnets in 4 years.

In the short term, we've got 10 game changing projects ready to use revnets. We need to make sure they are all wildly successful, delivering revnets as the clear vision of how wealth will be most productively created and distributed in our future characterized by digital networks and cryptographic identities. 

### Bottom line

RRG will achieve its mission in three ways: build and market a great [revnet.app](https://revnet.app) – the trusted web link to browse and participate in revnets through, building dev tools that make revnets easier to integrate within financial and white labeled applications, and accelerating new revnets in dynamic ways.

While doing so, RRG will accumulate $REV. The $REV revnet receives a 2.5% network fee whenever someone cashes out from any revnet. The fee is used to either issue new $REV from its revnet or buyback $REV from the market, depending on which is a better deal. RRG receives a portion of both $REV issuance and buybacks as the fees come in. More on this [below](#rev). 

RRG will also have leverage to charge fees when facilitating access to revnets for traditional institutions.

### Pitch to investors

We encourage investors to participate directly in the $REV revnet from their favorite EVM chain, see [below](#rev) for details. The first 90 days of revnet will favor grassroots investors.

For those investors who prefer interacting with a corporation in fiat instead of accessing $REV directly, RRG can facilitate access while also charging a 1% management fee per year of management, paid in $REV.

<!-- TODO: This is YC Safe and not Gnosis, right? We should specify which kind (post-money MFN no cap no discount?) and combine with the prior section. -->

### Structure 

RRG is an LLC owned by Jango, Filip, Aeolian, KMac, and Rob. RRG is a [$REV](#rev) token holder alongside other holders.

### Onchain management 

Onchain, RRG will manage its $REV with a 3/6 multisig at `rrg.rev.eth`. The multisig is controlled by:

- `breadfruit.eth` (jango)
- `filipv.eth` (Filip)
- `codalabs.eth` (Aeolian)
- `kmac.eth` (Kmac)
- `dao.jbx.eth` (JuiceboxDAO)
- `openesquire.eth` (Robert Leonhard)

### Offchain management

Offchain management of the corporation will be led by Jango, Filip, Aeolian, KMac, Robert, and other members of the Juicebox community:

[Jango](https://jango.eth.sucks) founded and has developed the [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money) protocol to support organizational money experiments on the public internet.

[Filip](https://filip.world) has been working on Juicebox since November 2021, focusing on documentation, off-chain tools and services, and frontend development, as well as directly supporting many Juicebox project creators.

[Aeolian](https://x.com/aeolianeth) has been working on Juicebox since November 2021, and leading the development of [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) since 2022. Aeolian also makes essential tools to support the Juicebox ecosystem: [juicescan.io](https://www.juicescan.io), the [Juicebox SDK](https://github.com/Bananapus/juice-sdk-v4), and the in-progress [revnet.app](https://revnet.app).

[KMac](https://kmacb.eth.limo) is an experienced entrepreneur who has been contributing to multiple DAOs including Solace, Purple, Juicebox and Defifa.

Robert Leonhard is the co-founder of [Open Esquire](https://openesq.tech), a group of legal engineers serving Ethereum projects and many Juicebox projects.

### Ideal partners

Anyone is welcome, though we want to especially encourage partners who want to help with growth strategies and could see themselves using revnets in other areas of their portfolio. We (folks from around the Juicebox community) are about to deploy Juicebox v4 and the first [cohort of production revnets](#examples-of-revnets). We're looking for partners who believe in the mission, believe in the team, and can help make this launch chapter successful.

We want to invite both token-confortable people to interact directly from their favorite EVM blockchain, and token-curious people to interact through RRG.

### Roadmap

1. Grow by facilitating growth. Help revnets accept more money by building great products like [revnet.app](https://www.revnet.app) and offering services to offchain institutions which allow them to participate in revnets. 
2. In 8 years, once there are hundreds of billion dollar networks running as revnets, consider either heading towards an IPO explicitly to give conventional financial markets exposure to $REV and the rest of RRG's revnet-based portfolio, or skipping to step 3.
3. In 15 years, consider cashing out of $REV and other positions and offering buybacks – doing so will consolidate the $REV network's value towards remaining holders.

### Spend

RRG will use the bulk of the $REV it earns to support the launch, security, and marketing of revnet.app and associated revnets over the next 3 years. We will use some of the $REV to staff jango (project/tech lead), filip (ops/tech lead), aeolian (consumer/tech lead), kmac (marketing/tech lead), rob (legal).

## $REV

$REV runs on its own as a revnet according to the rules below – there is no governance. RRG is a token holder alongside other token holders and has no special powers. Anyone can participate in $REV at any time.

### Anatomy of a revnet

Each revnet has a token and is defined in stages. Each stage specifies five rules which dictate how the revent operates:

- **Duration:** How long does the stage last? A revnet’s final stage lasts forever.
- **Price:** 
    - **Starting price:** How much does it cost to buy a single token when the stage begins? The payment's value stays within the revnet and can only be accessed by token holders who cash out.
    - **Price increase:** How frequently, and by how much, does the token's price increase within the stage?
- **Split:** What percentage of token issuance (and buybacks) are set aside for a list of recipients, and which address is the split operator? The split operator can add, remove, or modify recipients from that list, changing how the split is allocated within the fixed percent set for the stage.
- **Automint:** How many tokens get minted to a list of recipients at the start of the stage? This functions like a "pre-mint" only accessible once the stage has started.
- **Cash out tax:** How much does the revnet's next potential cash out value increase each time a token holder cashes out?

If token holders add liquidity to an [AMM](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/uniswap-protocol#order-book-vs-amm) and it offers a better price than the revnet, the revnet will route incoming payments to that market instead of issuing new tokens. The revnet's split is applied to these buybacks as well.

Built using Juicebox v4, revnets can grow to accept money on new [EVM-compatible networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) as they emerge, and also offer cash outs on those networks. Holders can move their tokens between chains, and when they do, the revnet automatically moves funds to back those tokens to maintain those tokens' value.

### $REV stage 1

- **Cash out tax:** No change. Medium-high (0.6).

## Legal

Each revnet’s rules are defined up front, and all transactions are public. Once a revnet is deployed, no manager has the power to change how it works, no supervisor has special backdoor access, and no authority can stop it. There is no managerial effort attached to an expectation of profit.

Now is the time to learn from the legal outcomes of the past few years and bet on deterministic mechanisms where no entity can change or control the rules once deployed, and where all information is publicly auditable.

RRG has it's own managerial efforts and is therefore selling structured access to a C corporation through a SAFE, but only engages with the $REV economy as a token holder.

<!-- TODO: We should add pre-money/post-money to the SAFE above. Also, we should just use "safe", though it also implies gnosis. -->

## Investor FAQ

### Should I invest in RRG, $REV, or...?

There are three core entities in play: $REV, RRG LLC, and JuiceboxDAO ($JBX). According to the $REV specs above, RRG and JuiceboxDAO are both expected to receive a split of $REV issuance and buybacks, making them great proxies to build ongoing exposure to $REV's revenue growth – albeit subject to the risks associated with each entities' governance process.

- The only current way to access the ecosystem for participants who don't want to access tokens directly onchain is through RRG. RRG will facilitate revnet interactions on traditional investors' behalf, albeit for a management fee. RRG is not investible directly.
- For those comfortable accessing tokens onchain, $JBX is a fixed-supply governance token which has been on the market for several years, now utilizing its treasury to build out the Juicebox ecosystem – the revnet project and several others were informally incubated from within JuiceboxDAO. You can learn more [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/).
- Also for those onchain, build direct exposure to $REV to benefit from revenue growth without proxies.

### What are the risks I should be aware of?

**Smart contract risk**: Revnets are built using the Juicebox V4 protocol which can exists across multiple EVM blockchains. Though it is a fork and iteration of Juicebox V3 that has secures tens of millions of dollars in locked value on Ethereum mainnet, there is the possibility of smart contract bugs that cause the system to collapse. JuiceboxDAO has spent the better part of the last year's time and budget on testing, documentation, and hiring third party auditors, though is always encouraging more eyes on the open source code base. Ultimately, smart contract security comes from production lindiness while managing funds at risk.

**Organizational risk**: $REV runs on its own and has no organizational risk. RRG and $JBX on the other hand, do have organizational risks exposed through the same governance means that affords them certain flexibilities to persue emergent opportunities. Engaging in either RRG or $JBX should warrent due diligence to understand how decisions have been made and how they'll likely continue to be made within those organizations.

**Market risk**: RRG is a for-profit organization that will look to build its $REV exposure and harness its specialization in revnets to become successful. We believe revnets are marketable and can outcompete alternative organizational structures, but this is an unproven thesis with projects outside of our own. Choosing an organizational token structure is a big decisions that each project tends to make only once and stick to forever afterward. It's hard to become the standard structure, but once the standard is set it tends to stick. At first, the revnet sales cycle will likely be long, we'll want to observe how the structure provides value both as a supportive component of already-existing organizations, and as the core piece of new orgs starting up. We'll lead the way with great examples of successful revnets folks can look up, starting with $REV, whose energy will help us reach critical mass.

**Immutability risk**: Though a revnet's immutability is its core value prop, some might also view this as a risk. A revnet is impossible to course correct once deployed and legitimacy has been established. Mainly, the $REV specification that determines issuance policy could turn out to not motivate activity as much as intended. A perfect revnet configuration is hard to know ahead of time, and there aren't many levers that expose control within its ruleset – like bitcoin, the hardcoded rules can only teleologically be deemed productive if the network proves itself in competition with forked alternatives. The two variables that do offer control and flexibility within the $REV revnet specs are the 38% split that rrg.rev.eth will operate, and the autominted tokens. RRG can play a part in reorienting priorities using the split in order to stimulate some desired behavior, and can reasonably expect the autominted token holders to act in the best interest of the network's growth.

[^2]: [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/overview) raises funds and employs developers under the for-profit Uniswap Labs, but the Uniswap protocol is governed by $UNI token voting. The competing interests of token holders and Uniswap Labs have led to a number of controversial decisions over Uniswap's fee switch, source code licensing, and cross-chain deployments. Other projects have faced similar controversies when the interests of token holders and developers have diverged.

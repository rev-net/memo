## TLDR

Today's crypto applications, social networks, and AI agents have a business model problem, rooted in the tensions between open source productivity and private value capture. This has too often lead to misallocated resources – the promoters of pump and dumps win, the innovative entrepreneurs left with scraps.

Revnets offer a promising solution, as an openly accounted-for tokenized growth engine for leaders, workers, investors, and yesterday's customers that helped make today possible, while removing common causes for disputes between them.

Importantly, revnets aren't just an esoteric tool for obscure internet subcultures. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink and prominent others say the necessary and inevitable tokenization of everything will enhance the landscape of finance. We've understood this for years. We think revnets will participate in the mainstream's vision by being the most productive structure for both large organizations and small businesses to tokenize revenues, fundraises, and financial partnerships throughout the globe. Revnets are the SAFE and C-Corp agreements of this economy but 100x better.

## Overview

> _This memo will quickly give context to the problem at hand, how revnets are positioned to play a role in shaping the future, and lay out the specifics of how you are invited to participate._

Openly accounted-for fundraises and revenues should outcompeting everything, by enabling:
- **Scaled Participation:** Global community accelerates experimentation, leading to more innovation.
- **Full Transparency:** Public code and accounting is more trustworthy.
- **Cost Effeciency:** Many managerial expenses are not needed when there are no secrets or artificial barriers to progress.

They struggle to enforce revenue-generation to pay for innovation, maintenance, and growth due to three core dilemmas:
- **Monetization Dilemma:** Taking on debts and generating scalable revenues while keeping information public encourages speculation and scrutiny.
- **Value Dilemma:** Public finances distracts from the enterprise's mission and may reduce incentive to participate on all fronts.
- **Dependency Dilemma:** Many profitable businesses rely deeply on open source components, yet don't have clarity on how to foster a productive financial relationship with its community, or motivation to do so unless developed in-house.

This makes realizing open ideals, especially for open source initiatives, reliant on free and inconsistent labor, donations, grants, or corporate sponsorship, when this should instead be the most investible category of internet business.

Blockchain agreements are the correct building block, but currently attempted solutions are incomplete with unsustainable tradeoffs:
- **Liquidity farming:** Tokenized models marketed as open and yield providing, but with implicit or explicit backdoors for insiders to dump on retail once they've filled their bags. 
- **Governance DAOs:** Tokenized voting systems that decide how raised funds and revenues should be spent, creating power struggles that get in the way of effective capital allocation.
- **Revenue sharing:** Tokenized guarentees that sales will be split between certain entities, but with no follow-on incentive for propegating network growth after fees have been extracted.

We need a growth-oriented solution that is sustainable, reliable, and massively scalable to help every business with an online presence realize their potential in the upcoming tokenized economy.

We think revnets might be it: A win-win-win openly accounted-for growth engine, for investors, builders, and retail customers of open source and beyond. Built by developers who've helped facilitate over $185 million in ETH payments over their past 4 years of experience building and marketing Ethereum-based tokenization infrastructure.

We're deploying a $REV revnet that'll capture 2.5% of all funds cashed out from fundraises and revenues from all revnets. We invite you to take part in $REV, the first 90 days favor grassroots investors on equal terms. We're also supporting the launch of revnets for ten other spectacular projects we've been working with, showcasing the power of this financial instrument and the role it can play in our economy.

## Anatomy of a Revnet

Think of revnets like bitcoin's halvening rule – once deployed, bitcoin's issuance policy leads to a guaranteed 21m supply over time. Instead of a fixed supply with periodic supply shocks like bitcoin, revnets enforce a certain other set of guarantees that determine where tokens go when it is paid and under what conditions tokens can be cashed out. Revnets are a fully pre-configured financial structure – although they can evolve over time, they do so according to rules which are set in place at the time of their creation. This means:

- **Governance-free**: Governance inefficiencies and takeovers of funds are impossible.
- **Management-free**: Revnets operate autonomously according to their pre-configured rules, making rug pulls and overreach impossible.
- **Liquid**: Revnets work with the open market to make and take liquidity, helping startups bootstrap growth and making market manipulation unfavorable.
- **Deterministic**: Investors, builders, community, and customers each acts within a revnet's known rules, enforced programmatically from start to finish.
- **Familiar**: Transparency and diligence are simple. Once one revnet's workings makes sense, all revnets make sense.

Revnets also inherit the best properties of Ethereum:

- **Immediacy**: Encode sophisticated financial relationships between global participants which would be impractical to manage with traditional contracts.
- **Clarity**: Allow for ownership and access rules that can't be subjectively misinterpreted.
- **Certainty**: Express clearly scheduled rules which cannot be broken.
- **Auditability**: Impossible to hide, simplifying diligence for all participants.
- **Connectivity**: Easy, reliable, and open access to and from other smart contracts, including other revnets for composable accounting schemas.
- **Everywhere**: Allow organizations to tokenize their revenue and fundraises on any EVM blockchain, expanding to new ones as they emerge and prove their legitimacy.

Each revnet has a token and is defined in stages. Each stage specifies five rules which dictate how the revent operates:

- **Duration:** How long does the stage last? A revnet’s final stage lasts forever.
- **Price:** 
    - **Starting price:** How much does it cost to buy a single token when the stage begins? The payment's value stays within the revnet and can only be accessed by token holders who cash out.
    - **Price increase:** How frequently, and by how much, does the token's price increase within the stage?
- **Split:** What percentage of token issuance (and buybacks) are set aside for a list of recipients, and which address is the split operator? The split operator can add, remove, or modify recipients from that list, changing how the split is allocated within the fixed percent set for the stage.
- **Automint:** How many tokens get minted to a list of recipients at the start of the stage? This functions like a "pre-mint" only accessible once the stage has started.
- **Cash out tax:** How much does the revnet's next potential cash out value increase each time a token holder cashes out?

If token holders add liquidity to an [AMM](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/uniswap-protocol#order-book-vs-amm) and it offers a better price than the revnet, the revnet will route incoming payments to that market instead of issuing new tokens. The revnet's split is applied to these buybacks as well.

Built using Juicebox v4, revnets can grow to accept money on new [EVM-compatible networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) as they emerge, and also offer cash outs on those networks. Holders can move their tokens between chains. When they do, the revnet automatically moves funds to back those tokens to maintain those tokens' value.

## Why now?

Dominant organizational and financial models have always suited the technologies of their respective eras. It isn't a coincidence that [joint-stock companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint-stock_company) were the defining structure of the mercantile era, that [limited liability corporations](https://www.jstor.org/stable/764920) played the same role during the Industrial Revolution, or that today's Silicon Valley startups are defined by the use of broad-based equity compensation like [Y-Combinator's Safe financing documents](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/).[^1] These each created favorable accounting conditions for collective risk-taking, and standardization for easier due diligence and enforcement.

In this era of distributed crypto, social, and AI networks that innovate on internet-native concepts, corporate-stock models of organization are anachronistic, leaving much to be desired for entrepreneurs, capital providers, and consumers alike.

Those of us developing revnets have been contributors to the Ethereum ecosystem over the past 4 years, most notably having helped build the Juicebox protocol, the juicebox.money app, and the Juicebox DAO community driven by the $JBX network. Juicebox is public infrastructure that provides a tokenized language for expressing various organizational financial guarantees. It has been used by Constitution DAO, Assange DAO, Shark DAO, Moon DAO, Cryo DAO, Juicebox DAO, the tornado cash developer legal defense fundraiser, and 1,331 other projects, facilitating over $185 million in ETH payments.

Revnets are now the next step, a particular expression of the Juicebox language. 

We've experienced the demand for tokenized fundraising and revenue first hand, we know the tradeoffs of the tokenization tools at our disposal intimately well, and we know how cultural narratives around tokens work. We've been consistently one step ahead of the curve and steadfast in our values.  

We've also seen the gross extractive tendencies that over-levered entrepreneurs, investors, and traders can succumb to when left unchecked. Blockchains give us transactional freedoms – using it to progress positive-sum financial applications is hard, using it to progress hyped-up zero sum ponzis is easy.

Revnets are the standard we need to encourage more projects to hit the gas without incumbent tradeoffs. Their time is now – revnets would be too fragile to exist if a rent-seeking fiduciary facilitating the handling of money and rules was required, and can only outcompete as an encoded contract between network participants enforced by the blockchain protocols of today.

## Thesis

Revnets can power millions of startups to become global movements, high net-worth interconnected economies, and retail-owned brands that outcompete traditional private alternatives.

With revnets, the open internet will win _because_ it best serves creatives, builders, investors, and consumers alike.

We're calling on partners who believe in a revenue-forward version of the open internet to join the $REV network.

## $REV

$REV runs on its own as a revnet according to the rules below – there is no governance. Revnet Research Group LLC (RRG) is a token holder alongside other token holders and has no special powers. Anyone can participate in $REV at any time.

We want to invite both token-comfortable people to interact directly from their favorite EVM blockchain, and token-curious people to interact through RRG.

### $REV stage 1

- **Duration:** 90 days.
- **Initial price:** 1 $REV costs 0.001 ETH.
- **Price increase:** None.
- **Split:** 20% split of issuance and buybacks operated by `rrg.rev.eth`. 10% routed to `rrg.rev.eth` (RRG), and 10% to `dao.jbx.eth` (JuiceboxDAO).

## Revnet Research Group (RRG)

We'll use an LLC named RRG to support the revnet ecosystem and help it interface with conventional tech and finance sectors.

We think it's important for RRG to set an example of how a corporate partnership can be successful as a scoped subcomponent of a public onchain revnet structure, in this case $REV. 

### RRG Mission

RRG will serve the growth and sustainability of open internet economies through revnets. We're shooting for $1 billion of assets locked in revnets in 4 years.

In the short term, we've got 10 curated projects ready to use revnets. We need to make sure they are all wildly successful, delivering revnets as the clear vision of how wealth will be most productively created and distributed in our future characterized by digital networks and cryptographic identities. 

### Bottom line

RRG will achieve its mission in three ways: build and market a great [revnet.app](https://revnet.app) – the trusted web link to browse and participate in revnets through, building dev tools that make revnets easier to integrate within financial and white labeled applications, and accelerating new revnets in dynamic ways.

While doing so, RRG will accumulate $REV. The $REV revnet receives a 2.5% network fee whenever someone cashes out from any revnet. The fee is used to either issue new $REV from its revnet or buyback $REV from the market, depending on which is a better deal. RRG receives a portion of both $REV issuance and buybacks as the fees come in. 

RRG will also have leverage to charge fees when facilitating access to revnets for traditional institutions.

### Structure 

RRG is an LLC owned by Jango, Filip, Aeolian, and KMac. RRG is a $REV token holder alongside other holders.

### Onchain management 

Onchain, RRG will manage its $REV with a 3/6 multisig at `rrg.rev.eth`. The multisig is controlled by:

- `breadfruit.eth` (jango)
- `filipv.eth` (Filip)
- `codalabs.eth` (Aeolian)
- `kmac.eth` (Kmac)
- `dao.jbx.eth` (JuiceboxDAO)
- `openesquire.eth` (Robert Leonhard)

### Offchain management

Offchain management of the corporation will be led by Jango, Filip, Aeolian, KMac, Robert, and other members of the Juicebox community:

[Jango](https://jango.eth.sucks) founded and has developed the [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money) protocol to support organizational money experiments on the public internet.

[Filip](https://filip.world) has been working on Juicebox since November 2021, focusing on documentation, off-chain tools and services, and frontend development, as well as directly supporting many Juicebox project creators.

[Aeolian](https://x.com/aeolianeth) has been working on Juicebox since November 2021, and leading the development of [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) since 2022. Aeolian also makes essential tools to support the Juicebox ecosystem: [juicescan.io](https://www.juicescan.io), the [Juicebox SDK](https://github.com/Bananapus/juice-sdk-v4), and the in-progress [revnet.app](https://revnet.app).

[KMac](https://kmacb.eth.limo) is an experienced entrepreneur who has been contributing to multiple DAOs including Solace, Purple, Juicebox and Defifa.

Robert Leonhard is the co-founder of [Open Esquire](https://openesq.tech), a group of legal engineers serving Ethereum projects and many Juicebox projects.

### Spend

RRG will use the bulk of the $REV it earns to support the launch, security, and marketing of revnet.app and associated revnets over the next 3 years. We will use some of the $REV to staff jango (project/tech lead), filip (ops/tech lead), aeolian (consumer/tech lead), kmac (marketing/tech lead), rob (legal).


## Legal

Each revnet’s rules are defined up front, and all transactions are public. Once a revnet is deployed, no manager has the power to change how it works, no supervisor has special backdoor access, and no authority can stop it. There is no managerial effort attached to an expectation of profit.

Now is the time to learn from the legal outcomes of the past few years and bet on deterministic mechanisms where no entity can change or control the rules once deployed, and where all information is publicly auditable.

RRG has it's own managerial efforts and is therefore selling structured access to a C corporation through a SAFE, and only engages with the $REV economy as a token holder.

<!-- TODO: We should add pre-money/post-money to the SAFE above. Also, we should just use "safe", though it also implies gnosis. -->

## Investor FAQ

### Should I invest in RRG, $REV, or...?

There are three core entities in play: $REV, RRG LLC, and JuiceboxDAO ($JBX). According to the $REV specs above, RRG and JuiceboxDAO are both expected to receive a split of $REV issuance and buybacks, making them great proxies to build ongoing exposure to $REV's revenue growth – albeit subject to the risks associated with each entity's governance process.

- The only current way to access the ecosystem for participants who don't want to access tokens directly onchain is through RRG. RRG will facilitate revnet interactions on traditional investors' behalf, albeit for a management fee. RRG is not investible directly.
- For those comfortable accessing tokens onchain, $JBX is a fixed-supply governance token which has been on the market for several years, now utilizing its treasury to build out the Juicebox ecosystem – the revnet project and several others were informally incubated from within JuiceboxDAO. You can learn more [here](https://docs.juicebox.money/dao/).
- Also for those onchain, build direct exposure to $REV to benefit from revenue growth without proxies.

### What are the risks I should be aware of?

**Smart contract risk**: Revnets are built using the Juicebox V4 protocol which can exist across multiple EVM blockchains. Though it is a fork and iteration of Juicebox V3 that secures tens of millions of dollars in locked value on Ethereum mainnet, there is the possibility of smart contract bugs that cause the system to collapse. JuiceboxDAO has spent the better part of the last year's time and budget on testing, documentation, and hiring third party auditors, though is always encouraging more eyes on the open source code base. Ultimately, smart contract security comes from production lindiness while managing funds at risk.

**Organizational risk**: $REV runs on its own and has no organizational risk. RRG and $JBX on the other hand, do have organizational risks exposed through the same governance means that affords them certain flexibilities to pursue emergent opportunities. Engaging in either RRG or $JBX should warrant due diligence to understand how decisions have been made and how they'll likely continue to be made within those organizations.

**Market risk**: RRG is a for-profit organization that will look to build its $REV exposure and harness its specialization in revnets to become successful. We believe revnets are marketable and can outcompete alternative organizational structures, but this is an unproven thesis with projects outside of our own. Choosing an organizational token structure is a big decision that each project tends to make only once and stick to forever afterward. It's hard to become the standard structure, but once the standard is set it tends to stick. At first, the revnet sales cycle will likely be long, we'll want to observe how the structure provides value both as a supportive component of already-existing organizations, and as the core piece of new orgs starting up. We'll lead the way with great examples of successful revnets folks can look up, starting with $REV, whose energy will help us reach critical mass.

**Immutability risk**: Though a revnet's immutability is its core value proposition, some might also view this as a risk. A revnet is impossible to course correct once deployed and legitimacy has been established. Mainly, the $REV specification that determines issuance policy could turn out to not motivate activity as much as intended. A perfect revnet configuration is hard to know ahead of time, and there aren't many levers that expose control within its ruleset – like bitcoin, the hardcoded rules can only teleologically be deemed productive if the network proves itself in competition with forked alternatives. The two variables that do offer control and flexibility within the $REV revnet specs are the 38% split that rrg.rev.eth will operate, and the autominted tokens. RRG can play a part in reorienting priorities using the split in order to stimulate some desired behavior, and can reasonably expect the autominted token holders to act in the best interest of the network's growth.

[^1]: Other recent examples: the gig economy, DAOs, and remote work.
[^2]: [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/overview) raises funds and employs developers under the for-profit Uniswap Labs, but the Uniswap protocol is governed by $UNI token voting. The competing interests of token holders and Uniswap Labs have led to a number of controversial decisions over Uniswap's fee switch, source code licensing, and cross-chain deployments. Other projects have faced similar controversies when the interests of token holders and developers have diverged.

Ethereum is one of a kind. We have incredible respect and gratitude for the work of our peers that make our contributions possible.
